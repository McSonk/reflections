What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Well... it initializes magical git stuff to keep tracking of the files in the
repo. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area differs from the working directory since the Working Directory is
the actual directory in which we are working on.
The repository is the logical unit of changes being tracked by git.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You could do several changes to the code and just add a few to the staging area, just the ones that
represent a logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When you have to do several changes to general performance or improvement, or maybe
just for fun
